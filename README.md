# Circular Buffer C++ Project

## Overview
This C++ project implements a circular buffer using a templated class with STL `std::array`. The circular buffer allows for storing and overwriting the oldest data when the buffer is full. For better understanding [REFER HERE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_buffer)

### Project Structure
- `Circular_Buffer.h`: Header file containing the implementation of the CircularBuffer class.
- `Dog.h` Header file containing implementation for Dog class used as a type in Circular Buffer
- `Test.cpp`: Contains initial tests for functionality.
