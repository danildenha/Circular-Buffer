# Circular Buffer C++ Project

## Overview
This C++ project implements a circular buffer using a templated class with STL `std::array`. In computer science, a circular buffer is a data structure that uses a single, fixed-size buffer as if it were connected end-to-end. This structure lends itself easily to buffering data streams. There were early circular buffer implementations in hardware. For better understanding [REFER HERE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_buffer)

### About the project
Within this project, the circular buffer utilizes intricate data within its cells, such as the Dog class that contains inside of the circular buffer cells. **To run and test the project, run 'Source.cpp'**
### Project Structure
- `Circular_Buffer.h`: Header file containing the implementation of the CircularBuffer class.
- `Dog.h` Header file containing implementation for Dog class used as a type in Circular Buffer
- `Source.cpp`: Contains initial tests for functionality.
